Default state is to randomly pick from alphaArray
if randomSelect is off
either convert based on array of preselected characters
or give exact indexes of characters needed in alphaArray?

toggle button between preselect and randomSelect
when preselect is active, buttons clicked will be pushed to preselectArray
one of each character will be necesarry

add delete button

when you click a character
the method checks if delete or preselect

if preselect change color of button and push to array
